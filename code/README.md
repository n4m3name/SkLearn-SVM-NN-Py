## Description:
Assignment 2 for SENG474 - Data Mining at UVic.  
Analysis of various machine learning algorithms in Scikit-learn using the [Fashion mnst dataset](https://github.com/zalandoresearch/fashion-mnist)

## Requirements:
The code is contained in a .ipynb file - To run you must have one of the following:
- Jupyter notebook (or another notebook editor which supports .ipynb files)
- `ipykernel` and an IDE supporting .ipynb files
- A running instance of https://uvic.syzygy.ca

Additionally, the notebook should be run in an up-to-date (Feb.2025) python environment with the following python packages:
- `pandas`
- `scikit-learn`
- `matplotlib`
- `numpy`

i.e. in your .env, run `pip install ipykernel pandas scikit-learn matplotlib numpy`

## Running code
To run a code cell, press `ctrl+return`

(If you are unable to run the code or unable to access .ipynb support,
a pdf of the code and output has been included in `code.zip`)

## Attribution
Deepseek.com was consulted frequently for efficient navigation of the various scikit ml functions.
Code was not copy-pasted from online (only within the notebook & from [A1](https://github.com/n4m3name/SKLearn-Trees-Py) as I'm sure is noticeable).
